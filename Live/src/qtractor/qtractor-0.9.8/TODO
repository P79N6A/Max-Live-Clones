Qtractor - An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer
----------------------------------------------

Qtractor's already in some kind of 'beta' stage of development and hence
fully functional. It surely has a plenty of lurking bugs. It also lacks
a few features that some might find critical in the application field.

All is not lost though, the following are among the ones planned to be
worked on in the times to come (not in any particular order or priority):

- Clip locking, muting.
- JACK MIDI support.
- OSC interface.
- Scripting.
- etc.

- Any other feature one can think of ;)
